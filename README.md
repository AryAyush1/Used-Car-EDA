Data analysis of used car database

Data Analysis or sometimes referred to as exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the core components of data science. It is also the part on which data scientists, data engineers and data analysts spend their majority of the time which makes it extremely important in the field of data science. This repository demonstartes some common exploratory data analysis methods and techniques using python. For purpose of illustration the used car database dataset has been taken from kaggle since it is one of the ideal dataset for performing EDA and taking a step towards the most amazing and interesting field of data science. Good luck with your EDA on the used car database dataset.


DataSet Overview:

The dataset is taken from kaggle and contains details of the used cars.

The Dataset includes various features such as price, resell value, perfomance and dimensional stats.

The dataset is not clean hence hence a data cleaning is carried out and missing values have been imputed.



Analysis:

Majority of vehicle are passenger type and majority size of engine are 2.0L and 3.0L.

Vehicles of brand Ford and Toyots are the most in number.

Average prices lies between 16k to 30k while the resell values lies between 11k to 20k.

Power performance factor and horsepower have a stong positive correlation with resell value but fuel efficiency has a negative weak correlation.

Vehicle type has no significant effect on the resell value of the vehicle.
